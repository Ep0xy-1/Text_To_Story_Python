# 🌌 Even if the Stars Fall

A Retro 1980’s Style Love & Escape Adventure — in Python with Tkinter
 
“You’re standing in your room. The glow of the green monitor flickers against the dark. Your parents are asleep… Leah is waiting by the cliffs. Do you sneak out, or stay?”

# 📖 About the Game

Even if the Stars Fall is a choice-based adventure game designed to look and feel like a 1980’s retro computer text-adventure, complete with:

Green/black CRT-style visuals

Typewriter-style text reveal

Glitchy background & flickering cursor

Branching storylines: sneak past your parents, reach the cliffs, and confess your feelings — or fail trying

This is more than a demo — it’s a full framework for building retro-style Tkinter games.
